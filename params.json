{"name":"Naftali Sappir","tagline":"Your Friendly Neighborhood Computer Expert","body":"I'm Naftali. I was born and raised right here in Jerusalem, and I help people with their computers.\r\n\r\nIn 1984 I became a programmer, and twenty years later, after founding a successful company, I decided to go on a new way. I took my technical experience and expertise and started using it to help people like you â€“ fixing your computers, helping you choose a new phone or PC, teaching you how to use your devices and programs, and answering all of your technical questions.\r\n\r\nI discovered that people of all ages appreciate my patience, friendly attitude, and professionalism. Next time you have a computer problem, maybe give me a call!\r\n\r\n## (+972) 528-328-877\r\nAvailable Sunday thru Friday, in English, Hebrew, German, and Arabic","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
