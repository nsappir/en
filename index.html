        <p>I'm Naftali. I was born and raised right here in Jerusalem, and I help people with their computers.</p>

<p>In 1984 I became a programmer, and twenty years later, after founding a successful company, I decided to go on a new way. I took my technical experience and expertise and started using it to help people like you â€“ fixing your computers, helping you choose a new phone or PC, teaching you how to use your devices and programs, and answering all of your technical questions.</p>

<p>I discovered that people of all ages appreciate my patience, friendly attitude, and professionalism. Next time you have a computer problem, maybe give me a call!</p>
